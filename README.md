# lem documentation project

lem is inherently unstable , if something goes wrong the text editor ide crashes
so cannot be running the lem editor and write about using the lem editor because a 
crash loses all the wokr thats been done 


# init file
```
~/.lem/init.lisp

lem text editor uses this similar to emacs ~/.emacs.d/init.el 
any examples of stuff can do like change background color on startup 
silence the welcome screen ?

```

# strategy

start by comprehending a file in contrib/tetris/tetris.lisp

defvar
(defvar *title* "main title")

defparameter 
(defparameter *title* "main title")

definition defvar / defparameter 
these define a global variable 

defpackage 
(defpackage )
